    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Bitwise_Project Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this Bitwise_Project application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your Bitwise_Project application.


Bitwise_Project.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

Bitwise_Project.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

Bitwise_Project.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named Bitwise_Project.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.

Nodes of mapFlag represent different characters in the town. You reach each person and they give you a little information about 
the world and possibly a quest. You go on a quest to find parts to fix your ship. Some people will direct you to dungeons where they
believe parts are, or will sell them to you for items you can get in the wilds (a secondary grid node wildFlag). There will be 
linear nodes for dungeons.

Consider: UI. Battle Sequences. etc...
